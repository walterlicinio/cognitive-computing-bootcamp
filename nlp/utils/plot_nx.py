    Args:
        df (NLPDataFrame): Class with a has-a relationship with
        pandas.DataFrame. It's DataFrame contains metrics like tf, df, tf_idf,
        etc.
        norm (int): since the tf_mean on df is generally really small numbers,
        we use this norm to multiply them so that the nodes can look better in
        the plot
        k (float): small float from 0.1 and 0.5 that is used as a
        parameter in the nx.spring_layout function that generates a dictionary
        with the positions of nodes from the nx.Graph
        iterations (int): one of the keyword arguments from nx.spring_layout,
        numbers smaller than 50 make the nodes position look like a big ring
        around some of the big nodes, it is a little hard to see the source of
        the edges so bigger numbers are prefered (like 80, 100 and 200)
        seed (int): nx.spring_layout used a deterministic random number
        generation for the generation of positions, we can then set the seed
        number to make sure we have consistent results
        savefig (bool): if set to True the plotted figure is saved as a png
        file, or not saved if False
